# Arkanoid
Clone of the famous Arkanoid game.

## Description
pygame clone of the Arkanoid game. The player can use the left and right arrow keys to control the pad and tries to destroy all blocks with the ball to move to the next level. With each level the ball speed and player speed increase.

## Bugs
If the ball collides with blocks too close to the joint between two blocks, the ball can continue in a straight line allowing to destroy blocks hidden behind the first blocks.
